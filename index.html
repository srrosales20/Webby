    <h1 class="display-4 text-center">What is UI and UX?</h1> 
    <p>
            Have you ever visited a webpage that functioned terribly? Maybe every feature worked correctly, but the layout was
            almost impossible to navigate, or the colors across the page was an eyesore, or maybe you weren't able to read 
            the content because the font was too busy. Now, think of a time you visited a high functioning web page. 
            The pleasing layout was smooth, you were able to find exactly what you were looking for, and maybe you enjoyed 
            the page so much that you explored it even more. 
            This is an example of the web developers' use of UX and UI design. UX stands for user experience, which is how 
            the user interacts with the page, and UI stands for User Interface, which is what the user sees through
            intentional formatting. These concepts should never be underestimated when it comes to developing a web page.
            Understanding how design heavily influences users' interaction with a web page allows developers to achieve 
            the goals of the page.

     <h1 class="display-4 text-center">Key concepts of UI and UX </h1> 
     <p>
         <h2>
            As web developers start to implement the concepts of UX and UI
             into their webpage, there are a few questions that should be asked throughout the process: 
         </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>    What are the goals of your webpage? </li>
            <li>    What are the end-users goals when using your webpage?</li>
            <li>    What questions do users need to answer when using your webpage?</li>
            <li>    What emotions do you want to invoke from the user? </li>
            </ol>
